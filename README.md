# ridge-regression

This notebook applies ridge regression on a synthetic dataset to create a linear model. It shows that ridge regression does minimise the weights of the linear model as needed. A gridsearch and the technique of cross validation is used to determine an ideal value for the alpha parameter of the ridge regression.
